A plugin to allow people using dynamic dependency versions to lock them to specific versions.

Some project teams may prefer to have their build.gradle dependencies reflect their ideal world. A latest.release for internal dependencies. A major.+, major.minor.+, or a range \[2.0.0, 4.0.0\). Many also want to lock to specific versions for day to day development, having a tagged version always resolve identically, and for published versions to have specific dependencies.

Inspired by [Bundler](http://bundler.io)
